         <p>Modern computing systems use different processors and memory systems to enhance performance. The CPU cache system consists of L1, L2, and L3 levels, which often store data that the processor needs so operations become faster (Hackenberg et al., 2009, p. 2). Due to limitations in size and expense, most active data exists in RAM which acts as the primary storage for working memory. System flexibility and power management operate effectively because of this hardware separation. CPU operations from RAM need are fulfilled through RAM but critical data accessed via cache memory leads to substantial speed-up of processing time. According to research evidence conducted by Molka et al. (2009) shows that the efficiency of multiprocessor systems depends directly on both memory performance levels and cache coherency effectiveness. 
            The GPU along with other specialized processors uses dedicated VRAM specifically designed to store graphical data during parallel computing tasks. The special layout exploits high-resolution texture processing for faster execution which decreases the CPU workload. Neural Processing Units (NPUs) serve the AI and machine learning requirements by delivering specific performance benefits for deep learning operations. The gaming performance has improved through AMD's Variable Graphics Memory feature which dynamically distributes system RAM for better performance because memory management continues advancing in computing systems (Macri, 2015, p. 20). System performance improves due to the way the CPU and GPU together with other specialized processors distribute computational tasks among themselves.
